## Task Descriptions

### 1. Debugging - Python Factorial

**Objective:**  
Identify and correct errors in a Python code sample that calculates the factorial of a number.

### 2. Debugging - Python Arguments

**Objective:**  
Identify and correct errors in a Python code sample related to handling command-line arguments.

### 3. Debugging - HTML / Javascript

**Objective:**  
Identify and correct errors in a sample code that combines HTML and JavaScript.

### 4. Debugging - Python Mines

**Objective:**  
Identify and correct errors in a Python implementation of the Minesweeper game logic.

**Game Overview:**  
Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### 5. Documentation - Python Factorial

**Objective:**  
Document a Python code sample that calculates the factorial of a number, explaining how the code works and any important details.

### 6. Error Handling - Python Checkbook

**Objective:**  
Document a Python code sample that simulates a simple checkbook application, focusing on error handling and best practices.

### 7. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python

**Objective:**  
Identify and correct multiple errors in a Python implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.

**Game Overview:**  
Players alternate placing "X" or "O" on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
